4.1.1Limitations of tracking

Template matching is sensitive to large head pose variations, occlusions, and illumination changes

Scale changes (subject moving closer or farther from the camera) cannot be handled during tracking

Fast motion exceeding the search window may cause tracking failure

Background regions with similar appearance can lead to false matches

4.1.2 Parameter tuning

Larger search windows improve robustness but increase computation and false matches

Higher similarity thresholds trigger re-detection more frequently, while lower thresholds may cause drift

Parameters must be tuned experimentally to balance robustness and efficiency
